# Loan Approval Analysis

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history.

This notebook aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this.
